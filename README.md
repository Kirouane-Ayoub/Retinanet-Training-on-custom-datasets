# Retinanet Training on your custom-dataset : 

RetinaNet is a single-stage object detection algorithm that combines the strengths of two popular object detection approaches: anchor-based methods and anchor-free methods. Unlike traditional anchor-based methods, RetinaNet does not rely on pre-defined anchor boxes and instead predicts object bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from feature maps. This approach results in a simpler and more efficient architecture, while still maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, RetinaNet addresses the issue of class imbalance in object detection by using a novel loss function that balances the contributions of positive and negative samples.
